Diversity in Coding</H2></center>
<br><br>
<p class="indent">As a cisgender white male in the coding world, I assumed that I brought little if any diversity to the coding world.  For those not familier with the term cisgender, it means that I identify as the gender I was assigned at birth.  The <a href="https://techjobstour.com/">Tech Jobs Tour</a> is aimed at bringing diversity into the coding and tech industries and I never thought about myself as adding diversity until this conference.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="https://techjobstour.com/">Tech Jobs Tour</a> states thier goal and purpose thusly: "Women, people of color, and LGBTQ people are opting for more affordable and accessible coding bootcamps and online education programs over 4-year computer science degrees. At the heart of our events is a deep commitment to representation in tech. We do that by showcasing top tech talent who are changing the world, who happen to be women, people of color, LGBTQ, veterans and people with disabilities. Our goal is to push the industry towards a higher standard, a technology sector that is representative of the people who live in this country. because we believe, together, we can and will change the face of technology to help American workers get the jobs they deserve."</p>
<p class="indent">West Virginia is not known as a racially diverse population.  We are not thought of as progressive, but what we bring to the table is a different kind of diversity.  West Virginia was the only state with a decline in home prices between Q3 2014 and Q3 2015, with prices falling by 0.1%. The state's labor market is also suffering: The November 2015 unemployment rate of 6.5% was the third highest in the country, and West Virginia was one of only five states to see a drop in nonfarm payroll employment between November 2014 and November 2015, with a 1.4% decline.  West Virginia is economically poor and has been for quite a while, but we have learned to survive and thrive in the face of impossible odds.  We don't give up.  We look at what others say is an impossible situation or problem and overcome it.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that is what makes us coders.  We solve problems others thought impossible.  Coders do not give up.  We present multiple solutions to any issue and try them out until we find one that works.  Diversity in the coding world absolutely means that we need more coders who look nothing like Richard Hendricks of HBO's <a href="http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</a>, but it also means we need more people from West Virginia and the appalachia region in the field.  And so far, that is what it looks like Coding in Clendenin.</p></div>

Replacing the Floor like a Coder</H2></center>
<br><br>
<p class="indent">I married up.  My wife is the most amazing person I have ever met and one thing I have learned after 9 years of marriage is that if she believes I can do something, I have a way of making it happen.  Our current project is replacing the floor in the master bedroom of our old farm house.  It is hard work because the room is not square and while the floor is now level, the walls are not.  This presented a problem when coming to a section where the flooring could not be placed normally.  Rather than hack through it, I convinced my wife to approach the problem as a coder.</p>
<p class="indent">As a coder, I have learned that when you approach any new problem the best approach is well thought out.  Sure, I could have broken out my saw and made things fit, but that was not the best option.  We stepped away from the problem and came back with three potential solutions.  After discussing and prototyping the solutions, we settled on one and it worked!</p>
<p class="indent">In life and in code, there are times where you just have to push through and get to a solution.  However, most times it is better to step away only to come back later with multiple potential solutions and see what works best for the particular problem.  Break big problems down into smaller, more manigable problems.  That is what I have learned Coding in Clendenin</p></div>

How I got into Software Development</H2></center>
<br><br>
<p class="indent">I have worked in IT most of my adult life.  A number of years ago when I set off for college, I began Majoring in Computer Engineering as I enjoyed working with and on computers.  However, I was working my way through school and having little time to complete rigorous homework; Calculus did me in.  I graduated a number of years later, but not with a degree in engineering.  I found myself working front line technical support at a major communications company and worked my way up to eventually the role of Network Compliance Analyst.  Functionally working in the world of CCNA, I was dealing with code, but was not able to modify or create it.  I then moved to the state of West Virginia and into a position as a Software Tester/Trainer.  My job was to test the graphical user interface end user experience to ensure changes made by programmers did not cause bugs and errors and report back when they did.  I was working with coders, but was never able to look at the code.</p>
<p class="indent">In July of 2016, I was informed about a free coding bootcamp called Mined Minds.  It was geared at teaching out of work Coal Miners to become software developers and was now open to anyone willing to put forward the effort.  In those 16 weeks we covered Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL, and some Javascript.  It culminated in a community project in which I and 3 other students wrote a web-wrapper for an educational game coded in Unity.</p>
<p class="indent">Upon graduation, I was offered an apprenticeship with Mined Minds Consultancy.  At this point, I had a decent grip on Ruby, HTML, CSS, and SQL and was honestly afraid of Javascript since I had only used it a few times.  My first project did not require Javascript, however we were tasked to natively build and Andriod and Iphone app for a client.  I had to learn Java and Swift enoough to get a working product but that is another story that will come later.  That is how I began Coding in Clendenin.</p></div>
